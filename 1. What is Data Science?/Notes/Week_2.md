# Big Data and Data Mining

## Foundations of Big Data
- Digital devices create a large amount of data.
- Ernst and Young: "Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management and enhance shareholder value."
- Different definitions common attributes:
    - Velocity: speed of accumulation of data.
    - Volume: scale of the data/amount of storage.
    - Variety: Structured vs unstructured. Sources (drivers).
    - Veracity: Quality. Consistency/completeness/integrity/ambiguity.
    - Value: ability to turn data into benefits.

## What is Hadoop?
- Distribution: Take a large dataset, slice it. *Map* the slice and the program to analyze it to a bunch of computers. *Reduce* the results to origin.
- Data science: bunch of existing tools with the added computational power.
- We can explore the whole dataset to find patterns.

## How big data is driving digital transformation?
- The inclusion of data science is driving changes in business and industries.

## Data science skills and big data

## Data Scientists at New York University

## Data mining
- Analysis of simplified, selected, tidied up data.

# Deep Learning and Machine Learning

## What's the difference?
- Big data: big datasets with varied content that cannot be worked with using traditional tools or techniques.
- Data mining: Automatically searching and analyzing data. Involves preprocessing to prepare and transform the data.
- Machine learning: subset of AI where the algorithm is not hard coded and instead deducted from training data.
- Deep learning: subset of machine learning that specifically use layered neural networks.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Linear algebra.
- Large computing power: GPUs.

## Applications of machine learning
- Recommendations.
- Classification.
- Predictive analytics.
- Fraud detection.
- Importance of knowing tradeoffs of special techniques.

## Regression
- Quantification of effect of a certain parameter to the final value.
